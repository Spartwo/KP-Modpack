description = HQ-9 Anti-aircraft missiles System Is developed independently by the second institute of China aerospace science and industry group, the new generation of long-range air defense missile system.
Red flag - 9 naval shipboard air-defense missile is sea, the red flag - 9 anti-aircraft missile, main equipment in the new generation of Chinese navy type 052 c destroyer destroyers and 052 d type, its export version called fly shield - 2000 (FD - 2000), anti-radiation missile version of FT - 2000.
On September 26, 2013, Turkey's defense ministry announced that China's sophisticated import and export company of FD - 2000 air defense missile system beat rosoboronexport S - 400 company tatarian aster air defense missiles, Europe and the United States of lockheed's MIM - 104 air defense missiles, the Turkish army T - Loramids long-range air defense missile system.
